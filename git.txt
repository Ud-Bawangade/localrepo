A very useful feature of the git clone is that it allows cloning a specific branch of the
target repository without having to clone the entire repository.
To clone a specific branch, you need to use the command -b to specify the branch.
The following command is used:
git clone -b <Branch_name> <Repo_URL>


6. Git Branch
