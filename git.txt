1. Uses of Git
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code.
Distributed version control tool used for source code management.
Allows multiple developers to work together.
Supports non-linear development because of its thousands of parallel branches.

2. Features of Git
Free and open-source
Tracks history
Supports non-linear development
Creates backup
Scalable
Supports collaboration
Branching is easier
Distributed development.

3. Git WorkFlow
In Git, the workflow is mainly divided into three areas -

Working directory - This is the area where you modify your existing files.
Staging area (Index) - In this, the files in your working directory are staged and
snapshots are added.
Git directory or repository - It is basically where you perform all the changes
that need to be made i.e. perform commits to branch, checkout branch, make
changes etc.
4. Install Git: Installation in Windows/Linux/Mac OS X
Install Git on Windows -
Download the latest version of Git from here.
Aȅer starting the installer, follow the command on the screen and press Next to
complete the installation.
Open Command Prompt and run the following command to configure Git on

$ git config --global user.email "user_emails@interviewbit.com"
This configures Git on your PC with your username and email.

Install Git on Linux -
You can install Git on Linux using the command apt-get :
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git

5. Git Clone
git clone is a command which is used to clone or copy a target repository.
The following image shows an illustration of the git clone command. Using the
command, a copy of the original repository is created.
How to clone a repository?
Open Github and navigate to the target repository which needs to be cloned.
Under the repo name, click on the tab Clone or Download.
An option named Clone with HTTPS appears.
Copy the Clone URL.
Open a command line and use the command: git clone <repo_URL>




In this way, a clone of the target repository can be made.
Clone a specific branch from the repository.
A very useful feature of the git clone is that it allows cloning a specific branch of the
target repository without having to clone the entire repository.
To clone a specific branch, you need to use the command -b to specify the branch.
The following command is used:
git clone -b <Branch_name> <Repo_URL>


6. Git Branch
A branch in Git is used to keep your changes until they are ready.
You can do your work on a branch while the main branch(main) remains stable.
Aȅer you are done with your work, you can merge it to the main branch.
For creating a new branch, the following command is used :
git branch <branch_name>



7. Git Switch Branch
Using the git checkout command, we can switch from one branch to another.
Command :
git checkout <branch_name>
8. Create Remote Branches
Git doesn’t allow creating a new and isolated branch on a remote repository. But, you
to make a branch remote, we can push an existing local branch.
The steps to create a remote branch is as follows:
Create a local branch and switch to that branch:
git checkout -b <branch_name>
Push in the local branch:
git push -u origin <branch_name>
Note: origin is the default name of remote
Now, if someone wants to fetch some information, one can simply run:
git fetch
git checkout <branch_name>
9. Delete Branches
Once the work is done on a branch and merged with the Main branch, one can delete
the branch.
The following command is used to delete branches:
git delete -d <branch_name>
Note: This command deletes a copy of the branch, but the original branch can
still exist in remote repositories.
To delete remote branches, use the following command:
git push origin --delete <branch_name>
